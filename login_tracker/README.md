## Login Tracker
A simple module that tracks each time a user logs in and stores a historical
record in your database. This data is then queryed by the Display Table Controller and called by a custom Block Plugin.

## Views integration
If you wish to create a custom View instead of using the premade block that is all setup.

##Installation
It is assumed that the Database is setup as the problem described and so no installation schemas are nessicary
