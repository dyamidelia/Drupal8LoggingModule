#PreAmble
I have not been at home since the heat has been intense. I got an email to start this project yesterday evening while I was away. Thankfully I had an old i5 laptop with me. I setup a new Xampp Server with a Drupal install. Bitnami sucks and ate a lot of my time.

# Drupal8LoggingModule
A logging Module for Drupal 8 that uses the Block Plugin for Display.

#Drupal 8 concepts Learned
Templates,

Mostly used Drupal Dev Docs and StackOverFlow.

## Login Tracker
A simple module that tracks each time a user logs in and stores a historical
record in your database. This data is then queryed by the Display Table Controller and called by a custom Block Plugin.

## Views integration
If you wish to create a custom View instead of using the premade block that is all setup.

##Installation
It is assumed that the Database is setup as the problem described and so no installation schemas are nessicary

##USAGE
The Block name is login_block in the Catergory Login Tracker
